# Backstress Radial Return Stress Update

Base class which calculates the effective inelastic strain increment required to return the isotropic
and/or kinematic stress state to a J2 yield surface.  This class is intended to be a parent class for
classes with specific constitutive models.


See (RadialReturnStressUpdate.md) for details on algorithm implementation.

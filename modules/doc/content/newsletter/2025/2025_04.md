## MOOSE Improvements

### `capabilities` parameter in `tests` specs

The MOOSE test harness provides numerous parameters to skip tests depending on capabilities
provided by the current executable. We have checks for the `petsc_version`, `required_submodules`,
the configured `ad_size` etc. Those checks all require custom python functions that parse
configuration files and probe the source tree.

The new [`capabilities` parameter](Capabilities.md) combines all the test harness parameters that probe
built-in functionality of the executable, and provides a flecible boolean expression parser to construct
abitrary conditions that test execution depends on. Capabilities now relies on an application
internal registry that can be queried with the `--show-capabilities` option. For example

```
    min_ad_size = 150
    method = '!dbg'
```

is now

```
    capabilities = 'ad_size>=150 & method!=dbg'
```

Application and module developers can register their own capabilities using the `addCapability` function.
Check `MooseApp::registerCapabilities()` for examples.

### Default support for multiple solver systems in the Steady and Transient executioners

The [Steady.md] and [Transient.md] executioner, as well as any `Executioner` relying on a [FEProblemSolve.md] solve object
can now solve multiple solver systems, e.g. nonlinear or linear systems. A variable can be placed in a solver system
using the `solver_sys` parameter of the `Variable`.

The solve of multiple systems can be iterated using the [!param](/Executioner/Transient/multi_system_fixed_point) parameter.
A [Convergence object](syntax/Convergence/index.md) must then be specified to the `Executioner` to assess the convergence
of the multi-system fixed point iteration.

This support was also extended to the [Physics system](syntax/Physics/index.md), in which the `Physics` equations can be
set to be solved in their own solver system

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- Periodic boundary conditions are now more verbose, they will output intermediate setup data
  in their 'auto_detection' mode, and will error with a helpful error message if used using conflictual
  parameters, or with a non-existing primary or secondary boundary.
- All `Sampler` vectorpostprocessor will now correctly detect and throw an error when used with
  vector and array variables which they currently do not support. New `Sampler` VPPs could be created
  to support them.
- [ProjectionAux.md] can now handle 1D elements in a multi-dimensional mesh, such as for example
  thermal hydraulic channels in a multi-dimensional loop
